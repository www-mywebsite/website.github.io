            <h3 class="main all">
                Cells come in different shapes: round, flat, long, star-like, cubed, and even shapeless.</li>
            </h3>
            <p>There are many different shapes for cells, some can be round or star-like, while some can even be
                shapeless. The possibilities are endless.</p>
            <h3 class="main all">
                Most cells are colorless and see-through.</li>
            </h3>
            <p>When you look through a microscope, you will see that most of the cells have no color and you can see
                through them.</p>
            <h3 class="main all">
                The size of a cell also varies.</li>
            </h3>
            <p>Just like how the shapes of cells are different, their sizes also differ.</p>
            <h3 class="main all">
                Some of the smallest are one-celled bacteria, which are too small to see with the naked eye, at
                    1-millionth of a meter (micrometer) across.</li>
